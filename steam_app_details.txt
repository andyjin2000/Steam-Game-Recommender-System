Each team, alien and human, has a Commander. The Commander looks down on the battlefield and issues orders, places structures, collects resources, researches technology, and deploys abilities. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline10_StrategyShooter.jpg?t=1573758614\" /><br><br>Here are some gameplay examples: A human Commander could drop health packs and ammunition to a trapped marine squad, and deploy sentry guns to help them defend their position. Or an alien Commander could grow a new Hive to spread infestation throughout newly captured territory, allowing more alien eggs to spawn...<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline11_BattleRoyale.jpg?t=1573758614\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Two Unique Sides</h2><br>Aliens players choose to evolve into one of five lifeforms: The fast, fearsome Skulk can run on walls and deliver massive damage with its jaws. Lerks fly and deploy gasses to support their teammates in battle. Gorges heal other lifeforms and build tunnels, hydra turrets, walls, and other tactical structures. Fades blink in and out of battle, picking off marines with giant scythes. Finally, the giant Onos is so massive and so tough, that even entire marine squads can't take it down.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline11_Giblets.jpg?t=1573758614\" /><br><br>Marines wield rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, pistols, and other weapons. Cluster grenades can clear ventilation shafts of sneaky Skulks, flamethrowers make short work of alien structures and infestation, and boosts dropped by the Commander increase combat effectiveness. <br><br>When attacking on foot doesn't cut it, marines can construct hulking Exosuits wielding miniguns and railguns, and equip jetpacks for high speed assaults on alien Hives.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline5_ExoFiring.jpg?t=1573758614\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Long Term Development</h2><br>Natural Selection 2 receives constant updates.

Wield devastating weaponry as a Frontiersman marine, or become the xenomorph as a deadly Kharaa lifeform. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline2_FadeMarine.jpg?t=1573758614\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strategy Meets Shooter</h2><br>Natural Selection 2 is a First Person Shooter and Real Time Stategy game rolled into one! Each team, alien and human, has a Commander. The Commander looks down on the battlefield and issues orders, places structures, collects resources, researches technology, and deploys abilities. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline10_StrategyShooter.jpg?t=1573758614\" /><br><br>Here are some gameplay examples: A human Commander could drop health packs and ammunition to a trapped marine squad, and deploy sentry guns to help them defend their position. Or an alien Commander could grow a new Hive to spread infestation throughout newly captured territory, allowing more alien eggs to spawn...<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline11_BattleRoyale.jpg?t=1573758614\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Two Unique Sides</h2><br>Aliens players choose to evolve into one of five lifeforms: The fast, fearsome Skulk can run on walls and deliver massive damage with its jaws. Lerks fly and deploy gasses to support their teammates in battle. Gorges heal other lifeforms and build tunnels, hydra turrets, walls, and other tactical structures. Fades blink in and out of battle, picking off marines with giant scythes. Finally, the giant Onos is so massive and so tough, that even entire marine squads can't take it down.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline11_Giblets.jpg?t=1573758614\" /><br><br>Marines wield rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, pistols, and other weapons.
