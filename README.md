# Steam-Game-Recommender-System

Steam is the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming. It has over 7,000 games available, with over 125 million active users. This project focuses on building a game recommendation system for Steam users. That is, given a user's existing game record (i.e. which games they have played and their ratings of those games), we will develop an engine that proposes new games that the user may enjoy. We will extract data using the Steam Web API: GetOwnedGames for a sample of 5,000 users.
